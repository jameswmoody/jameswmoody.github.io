	<h1>Meet Catalonia</h1>
	<p>Catalonia is a beautiful 4-year-old Retriever mix with a gorgeous red-golden coat and golden eyes. She is incredibly smart and active, so she craves training and exercise. A few of her favorite things include Kong toys, chew toys, and riding in the car. Catalonia is a very well trained dog in the home and is house trained. She learns quickly and would love the opportunity to show an experienced owner what a wonderful companion she can make!</p>
